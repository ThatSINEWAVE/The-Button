## How to Play

- **Objective**: Click the button as many times as you can.

## Features

- **Dynamic Button Movement**: The button moves away from your cursor based on your mouse speed and proximity.
- **Confetti Celebration**: When you successfully click the button, a burst of confetti celebrates your victory.
- **Success Rate Tracking**: The game calculates and displays your success rate, so you can see just how elusive the button is.
